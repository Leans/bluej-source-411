How to make a BlueJ release
---------------------------

PART I - BUILDING BLUEJ RELEASE CANDIDATE (RC)
----------------------------------------------

Before start building, check the copyright years, which is usually needed only once every year.
The line to be updated is 'menu.help.copyright.line0', which is in the 'lib/english/labels' file.

 1. Set the right BlueJ version number (and RC number) in bluej/build.xml
    Add a GUID to package/winsetup/version-guid file (Get one at guidgen.com)
    Run: ant update-version-number
 
    This updates the version number in the Boot class and the README.TXT file.

 2. Tag the current source tree in version control.

 3. For Debian, run "fakeroot ant debian".  (You will need fakeroot installed: sudo apt-get install fakeroot)

 4. See HOWTO.make-win-version for details on the Windows release bundle.
    Short version: run "ant windows"
 
 5. See HOWTO.make-mac-release for details on the Mac release bundles.
    Short version: run "ant mac"

 6. Test. When okay, upload to server.

 7. Run "ant urls-rc" to check the RCs are in place and get a print-out of the URLs.  Include this in RC announcement email.
 

PART II - RELEASING BLUEJ
-------------------------

 8. Move the RCs and the source to the public
    server (currently www.bluej.org/download/files/).

 9. Run "ant urls-final" to check the ifiles are in place

 10. Update the BlueJ web site to announce the new version (available in SVN as trunk/www-bluej):
     - update the front page (index.html)
        - change version, date, and download links 
     - update the versions page (versions.html)
        - add section with version, date, changes and download links
     - update the Raspberry Pi page (raspberrypi/index.html)
        - change file name and download links

        
11. Update the file www.bluej.org/version.info
    The real location currently is: bluej:/home/bluej/www/version.info

12. In the bugs database (http://bugs.bluej.org/trac/bluej),

   1. Add a future release milestone ("Roadmap", "New Milestone").

   2. Mark the new release milestone as completed.  Use the option that
      Trac provides to retarget open bugs to the future milestone.
      ("Roadmap" -> click on milestone -> "Edit milestone";
       do not go through the Admin panel!).
   
   3. Also check that there are no bugs against the current release which are marked as
      FIXED but for which the milestone isn't set. Set the milestone to the new release
      for such bugs.
      
   
13. Also in the bugs database, add the new version so that bugs can be reported against
    it.
    
14. Update the support form at http://www.bluej.org/help/supportform.html - the drop-down
    version field should have the new version added as an option.

15. Send a mail message to bluej-announce@bluej.org, announcing the release.

16. More public announcements. See HOWTO.announce-release.
